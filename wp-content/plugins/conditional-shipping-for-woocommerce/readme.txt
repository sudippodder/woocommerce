Restrict WooCommerce shipping methods based on conditions. Works with your existing shipping methods and zones.

== Description ==
Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce allows you to restrict shipping methods based on conditions. For example, you can disable free shipping for orders weighing over 30 kg or create a special shipping method for large products.

The plugin works with your existing shipping methods and zones. You can restrict flat rate, free shipping, pickup or any other shipping method created with shipping zones.

= Example =

You have two flat rate shipping methods, Freight and Economy. Orders weighing under 30 kg are shipped with Economy shipping. Orders over 30 kg have to be shipped with Freight.

With Conditional Shipping you can set maximum weight (30 kg) for Economy and minimum weight for Freight (30 kg). The customer sees only the right shipping on the checkout.
